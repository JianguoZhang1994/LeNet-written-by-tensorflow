![LeNet-5 Architecture](lenet.png)
Implement the LeNet-5 deep neural network model. Written by `jupyter notebook` using `tensorflow 1.0.0`.

### Dependencies
This program requires:

* [CarND Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The program enviroment can be created with CarND Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

You can also check my `Lenet.html` for online result.

**Note:** This project is a implementation of `Convolution Neural Network`. It is not too dificult but can help get familiar with CNN.
